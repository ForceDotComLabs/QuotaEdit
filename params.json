Check out the \r\n  AppExchange listing [here](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B41EqEAJ). \r\n  \r\n* Access to quotas is governed by the following:\r\n  - Full read/write to all forecasts for those with View All Forecasts and \r\n    Manage Quotas perm\r\n  - Full read/write to subordinate quotas only for those with Manage Quotas\r\n    perm\r\n  - Read only for subordinate quotas for those without the Manage Quotas perm\r\n  \r\n* Version 1.5 is adapted for the Spring '14 release. It supports editing multiple Forecast Types,\r\n  if you have more than one defined.\r\n \r\n* For orgs with quarterly forecasts, a help message explains how to enter them \r\n  in the monthly view.\r\n  \r\n* Multicurrency orgs will show each quota's currency, with an option to change\r\n  it to any of the currencies defined for the org. An empty quota row will \r\n  default the currency to that user's default currency.\r\n  \r\n* When there is no quota for a user for a given month, it'll appear as blank. \r\n  If left blank, pressing the save button won't add a quota for this user. But\r\n  there is no option to delete a quota - removing the number from a previously-\r\n  saved quota will store a 0 value.\r\n\r\n* Partner users work just like regular org users\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n------------\r\n* In edit mode, quotas that are whole number quotas will appear with only one digit after the period, for example \r\n  USD 123.0 \r\n\r\nFound a bug?\r\n------------\r\nPlease don't rate the app as 1 star (unless it really deserves it). Instead, please create a new Issue for it on Github. I'm usually very responsive.\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
